## Projects

### TabMemFree
2011 - present

https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tabmemfree/pdanbocphccpmidkhloklnlfplehiikb

Those days I had a laptop with a very few RAM. Every app switch was taking ages because of swapping to and from HDD. And Chrome was contributing the most to this issue.

So I made a Chrome extension. It reduced RAM footprint and CPU load by "parking" inactive tabs to an empty page, while preserving tab title and icon. On tab activation it would go "back" in history to restore tab state almost immediately. It was the first extension of it's kind for Chrome, which I presented on a Google conference.

Years later Chrome provided an API to "suspend" tabs without loosing state or affecting the history. And a suspension automation later, making TabMemFree useless for good.

Techs: typescript, chrome extensions api


### Kloomba

Project closed soon after making the first working version.

Techs: python, google app engine, protobuf, memcached


### LEGO Storage System
2025

#### Problem
My son had a pile of LEGO parts split evenly across 5 IKEA Trofast boxes. While building, most of the time was spent on parts searching.

#### Solution
To fix that I made a LEGO parts storage system:
- analysed parts inventory
- defined distinct parts groups
- split groups by size, if size varied a lot
- conducted tests to verify and adjust grouping logic with end user's expectations
- picked sizes of 3D-printable inserts for IKEA Trofast boxes, that can accommodate groups, while taking as little space as possible, and letting locate a part within a group within a couple of seconds
- optimised 3D-printing settings to reduce print time and material used, while providing enough strength
- conducted assisted LEGO models assembly/disassembly sessions to verify system integrity under heavy load

#### Results
- x10 faster access time
- x3 less searching noise
- x5 sell parts on the floor

I make systems everywhere I go :)



## Recommendations

### Ali Morshid
Senior Engineering Manager at SQUIRE
Ali managed Vitalii directly

> Vit's attention to detail and ability to think outside the box is something I truly admire. Vit has always challenged technical decisions and made sure we stayed on track and "did the right thing". He is a pleasure to work with through and through and it has been an absolute pleasure being his manager. I wish you the best of luck Vit, and I hope we cross paths again in the future.
